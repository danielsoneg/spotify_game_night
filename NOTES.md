# STATUS
- API works.
- Player works in chrome, therefore is done. Little ugly on start, but whatcha gonna do.
- Worker is working.
- Worker and API sharing "store" module, all async
- Have Main page. it's not good, but it is.

# PRIORITY
- Figure out error handling flow. Did stupid things initially, make retries more explicit
- handle logout better - chrome's not firing this
- Check for device each time - maybe store the device?


# TODO
- Overall:
    - Actual run model. Or not, who cares.
    - Tests
